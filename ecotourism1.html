          <div><li>
          The Nature Conservancy adopts the definition articulated by the World Conservation Union (IUCN):
	</li></div>
	<div><b>
	"Environmentally responsible travel to natural areas, in order to enjoy and appreciate nature (and accompanying cultural features, both past and present) that promote conservation, have a low visitor impact and provide for beneficially active socio-economic involvement of local peoples."
	</b></div>
	<div><li>
	Most tourism in natural areas today is not ecotourism and is not, therefore, sustainable. Ecotourism is distinguished by its emphasis on conservation, education, traveler responsibility and active community participation.

          <h1 id="2">Why should you care?</h1>
          <ul><div ><li>Increased tourism to sensitive natural areas without appropriate planning and management can threaten the integrity of ecosystems and local cultures. The increase of visitors to ecologically sensitive areas can lead to significant environmental degradation. Likewise, local communities and indigenous cultures can be harmed in numerous ways by an influx of foreign visitors and wealth. Additionally, fluctuations in climate, currency exchange rates, and political and social conditions can make over-dependence upon tourism a risky business.</li>

		<li>However, this same growth creates significant opportunities for both conservation and local communities. Ecotourism can provide much-needed revenues for the protection of national parks and other natural areas -- revenues that might not be available from other sources.</li>

		<li>Additionally, ecotourism can provide a viable economic development alternative for local communities with few other income-generating options. Moreover, ecotourism can increase the level of education and activism among travelers, making them more enthusiastic and effective agents of conservation.</li>

        <h1 id="3">Principles of Ecotourism</h1>
	<div>Ecotourism is about uniting conservation, communities, and sustainable travel. This means that those who implement and participate in ecotourism activities should follow the following ecotourism principles: </div>
        <ul>
        <div ><li>
    Minimize impact.
    </li>
        </div>
	<div><li>
	Build environmental and cultural awareness and respect.
    
	</div></li>
	
	<div><li>
	Provide positive experiences for both visitors and hosts.
    
	</div></li>
	
	<div><li>
	Provide direct financial benefits for conservation.
	
	</div></li>
	<div><li> Provide financial benefits and empowerment for local people.
	</div></li>
	<div><li>
	   Raise sensitivity to host countries' political, environmental, and social climate.
 
	</div></li>

        <h1 id="5">The Concern for Ecotourism</h1>
        <ul>
        <div ><li>Since ages, nature worship and the conservation ethics have been an inseparable part of Indian thought and traditions. Traces go back to ancient civilisations of India, when people used to nurture the philosophy of the oneness of life. The Indian tradition has always taught that, humankind is a part of nature and one should look upon all creation with the eyes of a love and respect. </li>
        </div>
        <div ><li> Today, the entire world is facing a deep crisis and is in the danger of being doomed. The rich forest areas and biological diversities have been relentlessly divested to erect concrete walls. The continuos denuding of forest reserves has led to Global Warming and Greenhouse Effects. Fortunately, this has led to some realisation, and now the world has awaken for new beginnings about human responsibility towards nature.
